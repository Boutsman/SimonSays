This project was executed by the academic engineering students Electronics and ICT at the University of Hasselt.   A demo-module was made, showcasing printable electronics and OLED technology, for the institute of material research.

Capacitive buttons
-The buttons are constructed of printed silver particles. Touch is detected through a 3mm thick sheet of plexi.
- Will be replaced with OLEDs.

Illuminated buttons
- By illuminating the plexi with an LED, engraved designs can light up.
- Will be replaced with OLEDs.
 
Slider
- By creating a row of isolated capacitive buttons, a slider can be created.
- Absolute, relative or switchable between the both?

Humidity sensor
- When moisture is added, the capacity of the sensor will rise.
- Design leads to bad SNR --> make sensor less complex (test old bachelorthesis designs with same code)
- Code a smithtrigger --> use sensor as timer.
